feat: layout builder tabs with placeholder picker and block reorder, live image preview

Layout Builder - 3 new left-panel tabs (Setup / Blocks / Placeholders):

Blocks tab:
- Drag-and-drop section reorder using HTML5 native drag API
- Visual drag handles with grab cursor, drop-target highlight, drag-opacity
- Per-block eye icon to toggle visibility (hides section in live preview instantly)
- Counter badge shows number of sections
- Advisory message when layout has only one HTML block

Placeholders tab:
- Full placeholder registry displayed in collapsible categories
- Copy-to-clipboard button appears on hover; shows green tick on copy
- Categories: Customer, Job, Dates, Addresses, Pricing, Measures, Branding, Loop Fields
- Customer/Job/Branding/Dates expanded by default

Live image preview on upload:
- Banner and footer image uploads now immediately inject URL into layoutConfig.globalStyles
  and call updatePreview so the iframe refreshes without requiring Approve & Save
- quote/page.tsx: globalStyles.heroBannerUrl / footerImageUrl take priority over
  job branding data, enabling live postMessage-driven image updates

Footer logo fix:
- Added max-width:180px, object-fit:contain, object-position:left center to prevent
  the company logo from stretching in the dark grey footer bar
