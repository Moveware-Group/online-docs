feat: dynamic branding images, placeholder registry, and accept section UX

- Wire hero banner and footer images from Layout Builder through to quote renderer
  - Upload paths saved to BrandingSettings (heroBannerUrl, footerImageUrl) on Approve & Save
  - Layout API merges branding images and font into layout globalStyles at serve time
  - Jobs API returns heroBannerUrl and footerImageUrl in branding object
  - grace-static.ts uses {{branding.heroBannerUrl}} and {{branding.footerImageUrl}}
    with static asset fallbacks via onerror
  - QuotePageData type and template resolver updated with new branding variables
  - DOMPurify config expanded to allow id, for, type, placeholder, href, onerror attrs

- Add lib/data/placeholder-registry.ts: central registry of all 40+ template variables
  organised by category (Customer, Job, Dates, Addresses, Pricing, Branding, Loop Fields)
  Foundation for the placeholder picker UI in the block editor

- Accept quote section UX improvements in grace-static.ts
  - Checkbox accent-color uses company primary colour when checked
  - Accept button disabled (grey) until Terms checkbox is ticked via pure CSS
    sibling selector (#grace-terms-checkbox:checked ~ .grace-accept-row)
  - Accept button enabled state uses company primary colour with white text
  - Terms link and heading use company primary colour for consistency
